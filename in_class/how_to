HOW TO CREATE A SOFT LINK:
* touch file1.txt                  VV
* touch file2.txt               create two files
* ls -il                        this is how you view the files with their inodes
* ln -s file1.txt my_softlink   this will create a soft link named my_softlink
* rm file1.txt                  remove file that the soft link points to
* ls -il                        observe that the file now has a dead link
HOW TO CREATE A HARD LINK:
* ln file2.txt my_hardlink      creates a hard link to the file (A DUPLICATE)
* ls -il                        view the new hard link. The two files are one in the same. modify one and it modifies the other.
* rm file2.txt                  remove original file
* ls -il                        notice that the link still works
